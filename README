RT keyboard shortcuts
=====================

Disclaimer: 
Use this at your own risk. This is my first Greasemonky script
and I'm not used to Javascript either...

Since I have to go through a couple of queues where we can't use
spam-filters (postmaster mail) I wanted a faster way to handle them.

INSTALL
=======

You'll need to have Greasemonkey for Firefox installed (should work
in other ways to be this is alpha code). Get the source file and 
change relevant parts of the file (search for CHANGEME). Please
let me know if you find anything else that needs changing!

Put your edited file on a web server and point your Firefox browser 
with Greasemonkey installed to the url and install the script in
Greasemonkey.

The next time you go to your RT first page and would like go no the
Postmaster queue and look through the _new_ tickets you can to the
following

Q (and enter queue name Postmaster, q will also show open tickets)
d (displays first message)
t (take the ticket)
o (open the ticket)
n (go to next ticket)
g->S (show results)
# (enter ticket number to open it)
? (open help)

BUGS
====

There will be bugs and since I use simple pattern matching and it is
so easy to install different addons you're urls might differ. Please
report bugs at http://github.com/reuteras/RT-keyboard-shortcuts.
